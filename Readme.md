# Fun In Maths

## Abstract
Mathematics is one of the important subjects in our daily life. To foster an interest in mathematics among students, we have developed a project that combines learning with gaming. As games are universally enjoyed, we believe that students will find it easier to understand, enjoy, and learn mathematics through games. Our project presents a selection of mathematical games designed to attract students towards mathematics.

## Introduction
The goal of our project, "Fun In Maths," is to help students develop an interest in mathematics by making it easier, more interesting, and attractive. To achieve this, we have created a Graphical User Interface (GUI) that includes five mathematical games. This interface is user-friendly and aims to provide an enjoyable learning experience.

## System Features
The GUI includes the following five games:

1. **Number Guessing Game**
2. **Birthday Finding Game**
3. **Mobile Number Finding Game**
4. **Erased Number Finding Game**
5. **Century Game**

## System Requirements

### Hardware Requirements
- PC or laptop

### Software Requirements
- JAVA (SE 8 or higher)

## Methodology
The project development process involved the following steps:

1. **Game Selection**: We selected five mathematical games that are engaging and educational.
2. **Development Environment**: The project was created using `Apache NetBeans IDE 15` with `JavaFX 19`.
3. **GUI Design**: We prepared GUI scenes using JavaFX components to ensure a smooth user experience.
4. **Game Logic**: The logic for each game was developed and implemented in Java.
5. **Testing**: After thorough testing of all the games, the project was exported as an Executable Jar file.

## Advantages
- **User-Friendly GUI**: The interface is designed for ease of use.
- **Easy to Play**: The games are simple and intuitive.
- **Encourages Interest in Mathematics**: The games are designed to help students develop a liking for mathematics.
- **Promotes Logical Thinking**: The games encourage logical and critical thinking.

## Future Scope
- **More Games**: Additional games can be added to the project.
- **Game Modes**: Introducing Player vs. Player (PvP) and Player vs. Computer (PvC) modes.

## Conclusion
Many students struggle with mathematics, often due to a lack of interest. Our project aims to address this by offering a simple GUI application with games that highlight the beauty of mathematics. We believe these games will help students understand and appreciate mathematics more deeply.
